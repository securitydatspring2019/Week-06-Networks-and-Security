# Week-06-Networks-and-Security (Wednesday, Thursday)

[snippet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeVxni4WxM2Kli7Nu68uioooiq4PnYOEeb1ZzMyQvsk/edit)

The purpose with this week is, to provide you with the minimal basic knowledge about the TCP/IP stack and related network protocols (TCP, IP, DNS, DHCP and ARP), necessary to monitor network traffic and understand the possible attacks that can be made against these protocols.

# Wednesday March 6 th.
## What to Install :cd:
I will assume you all have Kali installed for this week (so I only need to provide Linux-info). If this is *NOT* true for you, you must [install Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) before this lesson.


## What to Read or Watch :information_source:
:book: Read these sections from the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)
- Key architectural principles
- The sections describing each layer - Link Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, Application Layer

OR

:tv: Watch the first 43 minuttes of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNq4TrHP_U)

## Exercises :memo:
[Investigating TCP/IP, DNS and DHCP with Wireshark](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWqiRRHUWRHJwSSt1riu84ErxndVuWE_VxXOz4gjhPI/edit?usp=sharing)

# Thursday March 7 th.
Today we will focus on posible attacks that can be made against individual layers/protols. We will do this to increase our knowledge about network monitoring with Wireshark, and while doing this, introduce new penetration testing tools.

## What to Read or Watch :information_source:

First of all, make sure you have completed most of the exercises + reflections from day-1 in this week. Then

- [:book: SYN FLOOD Attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/) (3-4 min.)
- [:book: UDP Flood Attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/?utm_referrer=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/http-flood-ddos-attack/?utm_referrer=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/) (3-4 min.)
- [:book: ARP explained](https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccnp-route/arp-address-resolution-protocol-explained/) When ever this short article says "OSI Model" just think TCP/IP Model instead (5 min.)

- [:tv: Arp Poisoning Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTXAUJ2yqCg) (7 min) Watch, don't do until you know "what goes on" and then only if you are red
- [:tv: DNS Spoofing and MITM Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeWeAx3MRDA) (< 7 min)
